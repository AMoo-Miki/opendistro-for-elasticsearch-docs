# Upgrade to 1.10.1 (Kibana)

Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.10.1 includes a breaking change due to the Security Kibana plugin being re-implemented with Kibana's new plugin platform

## Security Kibana Plugin

If you:
* Upgrade Kibana from any of the previous versions to 1.10.1
* Use `Security Kibana Plugin` v1.10.1.1 or newer
* Use **unsecured HTTP** as the communication protocol

Then you need to add this line into your kibana.yml configuration file and restart Kibana
```bash
opendistro_security.cookie.secure: false
```

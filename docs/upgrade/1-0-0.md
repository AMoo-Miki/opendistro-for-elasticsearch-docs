# Upgrade to 1.0.0

Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.0.0 uses Elasticsearch 7.0.1, which has numerous breaking changes from 6.x.x. This page includes several important considerations when upgrading from Open Distro for Elasticsearch 0.x.x to 1.x.x.

- Cluster and index names can no longer contain the `:` character.
- Indices now default to one shard rather than five.
- Clusters now default to a limit of 1,000 shards per data node, which you can change using the `cluster.max_shards_per_node` setting. Primary and replica shards both count towards this limit, but any shards that are part of a closed index do not.
- `hits.total`, returned as part of search responses, is now an object, not an integer. If you created monitors using the Alerting plugin, you probably need to update them to use the new response format (`hits.total.value` rather than `hits.total`). The old format:

  ```json
  {
    "hits": {
      "total": 5
    }
  }
  ```

  The new format:

  ```json
  {
    "hits": {
      "total": {
        "value": 5,
        "relation": "eq"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Possible values for `relation` are `eq` (`value` is accurate) and `gte` (`value` is a lower bound).

  If you want to use the old behavior, add `rest_total_hits_as_int=true` as a parameter in the search request:

  ```json
  GET _search?rest_total_hits_as_int=true
  {
    "query": {
      "match": {
        "title": "wind"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  To update your monitors:

  1. Open Kibana.
  1. Choose **Alerting**, **Monitors**, and a monitor.
  1. Select a trigger and choose **Edit**.
  1. Change any occurrences of `ctx.results[0].hits.total` to `ctx.results[0].hits.total.value` and choose **Update**.

- Like Elasticsearch 6.x, indices can only contain one mapping type, but that type must now be named `_doc`. As a result, certain requests that used to require a mapping type no longer do. An old call to the bulk API:

  ```json
  POST _bulk
  { "index": { "_index" : "<index>", "_type" : "_doc", "_id" : "<id>" } }
  { "A JSON": "document" }
  ```

  A new call:

  ```json
  POST _bulk
  { "index": { "_index" : "<index>", "_id" : "<id>" } }
  { "A JSON": "document" }
  ```

# Upgrade to 1.11.0 (Kibana)

Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.11.0 renames the SQL Workbench plugin for Kibana to the Query Workbench.

Instead of incrementing the `opendistro_sql_workbench` version number, remove the plugin and install `opendistro-query-workbench` instead, as covered in [Standalone Kibana plugin install](../../kibana/plugins/).

## Anomaly Detection

If you’re upgrading from older ODFE versions, make sure you’re aware of the following:

### Previously created detectors

For detectors created prior to the upgrade, only admin users can assign permissions.
If an admin user uses a backend role, the detectors are not visible to any user, including that admin user.

Workaround: After upgrading to the new ODFE version, all admin users must update their existing detectors using the [Update API](../api/#update-detector). You only need to do this once and don’t have to repeat it for future upgrades.

### Users with no backend roles

All users must have an assigned backend role. If a user doesn’t have any backend role, the user cannot create detectors even with the correct permissions. This is because users are first filtered by the backend role.

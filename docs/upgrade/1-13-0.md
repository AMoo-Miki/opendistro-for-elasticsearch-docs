# Upgrade to 1.13.0

- Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.13.0 renames most plugins. For the latest plugin names, see [Standalone Elasticsearch plugin install](../../install/plugins/) and [Standalone Kibana plugin install](../../kibana/plugins/).

- Index State Management no longer supports the `index.opendistro.index_state_management.policy_id` setting for indices. Instead, add an `ism_template` to the policy. For more information, see [Index State Management](../../ism/).

# Other components

Open Distro has a number of additional components that you might want to use:

- [Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver](../../sql/jdbc)
- [PerfTop client for Performance Analyzer](../../pa/)
- [Alerting CLI](https://github.com/mihirsoni/odfe-monitor-cli), a command line interface that lets you use YAML files to manage your Open Distro monitors

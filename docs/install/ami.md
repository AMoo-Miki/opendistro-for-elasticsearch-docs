# Amazon Machine Image

For convenience, Open Distro publishes Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). These images use Amazon Linux 2 for their base image and come with Open Distro preinstalled.

You can find the images in the **Community AMIs** section of the EC2 console if you search for `Open Distro`.

- Choose an instance type with at least 2 GiB of RAM.
- Configuration and usage is no different than the standard [RPM](../rpm/#configuration) install.
